# DC -> MODS
A Python script to automate mapping from Dublin Core XML files to MODS XML files using only LXML. Certain DC elements were omitted in absence of a clear, default analogue in MODS.

## Usage
Place the Python file in the directory containing the Dublin Core XML files you'd like to convert to MODS. Run the script to generate your XML.
